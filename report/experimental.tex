\section{Experimental evaluation}
\label{section:experiments}

We compared performance of two different setups in Mininet framework. 
In Figure~\ref{fig:tput} we show the distribution of throughput for 
setup with hop-by-hop authentication enabled and with authentication disabled.
Clearly, authentication consumes lots of resources. Better design can consider,
using single key shared between all routers and employ authentication selectively
in order to save computation power of the forwarding elements.
